# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a hardcoded transition from Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus back to Proof of Authority (Clique) consensus at a specific block number in go-ethereum. This is needed when the beacon chain fails and the network needs to continue producing blocks using Clique consensus mechanism.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blockchain operator, I want to hardcode a transition from PoS to PoA at a specific block number, so that my network can continue producing blocks when the beacon chain fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current block number reaches the specified transition block THEN the consensus engine SHALL switch from beacon (PoS) to clique (PoA)
2. WHEN processing blocks after the transition block THEN the node SHALL use clique consensus rules for validation
3. WHEN creating new blocks after the transition THEN the node SHALL use clique block production mechanism
4. IF a block number is before the transition block THEN the node SHALL continue using beacon consensus
5. WHEN the transition occurs THEN existing chain state SHALL be preserved without corruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the transition block number to be configurable in the genesis configuration, so that different networks can set their own transition points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing genesis configuration THEN the system SHALL read the PoS to PoA transition block number
2. WHEN the transition block is not specified THEN the system SHALL default to never transitioning (maintain current behavior)
3. WHEN validating genesis configuration THEN the system SHALL ensure the transition block number is valid
4. IF the transition block is set to 0 THEN the system SHALL use PoA from genesis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network participant, I want the consensus transition to be deterministic across all nodes, so that the network maintains consensus after the switch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple nodes process the same block number THEN they SHALL all use the same consensus mechanism
2. WHEN a node restarts after the transition THEN it SHALL correctly identify which consensus to use for each block
3. WHEN syncing historical blocks THEN the node SHALL apply the correct consensus rules based on block number
4. WHEN fork choice occurs THEN the node SHALL use appropriate consensus rules for each competing chain

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blockchain operator, I want proper logging and monitoring of the consensus transition, so that I can verify the switch occurred correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transition block is reached THEN the system SHALL log the consensus engine switch
2. WHEN processing blocks with different consensus engines THEN the system SHALL log which engine is being used
3. WHEN errors occur during transition THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN the node starts up THEN it SHALL log the configured transition parameters
